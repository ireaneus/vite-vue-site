# VitePress ðŸ’™ StackBlitz

Hi there :wave: This is a demo running VitePress within your **browser tab**!

## Manual for Vue and Vite

So you can focus more on writing. Powered by MarkdownIt. Comes with many [built-in extensions](https://vitepress.dev/guide/markdown), and you can use Vue features in Markdown too!

This is pretty cool
